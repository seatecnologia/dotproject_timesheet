DotProject is a well known open source project management tool. DotProject is used to manage the day to day activities of project progression. But besides that, it can be used to manage your personal activities, just like a log of your work and hours worked. And it is pretty good, as you can have log reports for each user and/or task. However, this 'timesheet' function is not a main resource at dotProject. If a user has only one task where he/she logs all activities, it is easy to do so. But when you have a bunch of tasks, the navigation to log all your work gets pretty complicated. You have to 'find' each task, then log your work, then 'find' another task to log another job you did, and so on! And was thinking in a way to improve this funcionality of dotProject that we developted this new module!

This module was created to help users to log their activities. Instead of 'navigate around' dotProject looking for each Project/Task, all of the user's tasks are listed in one page. With 'Timesheet', all tasks can be logged in the same page.
These tasks can also be edited or deleted.
Moreover, once you complete a task, you can 'finish' it, setting its progress to 100%, only checking a box!

Another awesome part of this module, is the capacity to integrate your task's log to your Google Calendar!
